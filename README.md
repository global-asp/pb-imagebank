# PB Image Bank
This is a repository of open-licensed images derived from the stories in the [Pratham Books](http://prathambooks.org/) collection.

## Source
The image bank was created as a side effect of generating the stories for the [Global Pratham Books Project](https://github.com/global-asp/global-pb).

## Image sizes

Since the original images are relatively large, they have been made available in this repository in two different sizes for convenient re-use in other applications. The original size images are in the `large` folder. The images in the `medium` folder are approximately half the size of the corresponding images in the `large` folder.

## Metadata

Complete metadata for all images can be found in the files located in the `metadata` folder. Full image attribution, including the illustrator, license, source story, and a description of each image are included. To see the images in their original context, click on the link provided in each file to the corresponding source story on the [StoryWeaver website](https://storyweaver.org.in/), where you can read or download the story as a pdf or epub file.

## Stats
There are 3900+ open-licensed images in this repo, extracted from the 422 core stories that make up the [Global PB corpus](https://github.com/global-asp/global-pb).

## License
All images in this repository have been released under a Creative Commons license ([CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)), with the exception of about 40 or so images which are Public Domain. The license for each image can be found in the appropriate file in the `metadata` folder.
